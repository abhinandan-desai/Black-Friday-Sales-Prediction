# Sales Prediction and Analysis
Accurate sales forecasts can enable companies to make strategic business decisions and predict the performance of sales in the near future. It also gives
an insight to work out the workforce, costs, and resources of a company. Past sales data, economic, seasonal
and location trends are some of the major factors that help to generate accurate forecasts. Predictive sales
also help companies and businesses to plan their future growth and expansion.

This project focuses on creating a system that will conduct regression analysis on sales data of
Black Friday and try to predict accurate.

# Applied Regression Methods
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression 
- Elastic Net Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) Regression

# Conclusion
In conclusion, it can be observed that:
- eXtreme Gradient Boost Regression gives the least RMSE score and hence it performs the best. The reason for this is that the XGBoost uses both linear regression and tree algorithm. 
- The regression tree models perform better as compared to models using linear regression. 
- RMSE for the elastic net regression improves after tuning both the parameters - alpha and lambda. 
- Most of the regression showed that 1, 4 and 7(Gender, City_Category and Product_Category_1) are the best predictors.
